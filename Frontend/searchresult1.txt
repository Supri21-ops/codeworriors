### üìå General Observation

These are **UI wireframes/mockups** for a **Manufacturing / Inventory Management System**.
The system revolves around **stock, manufacturing orders, bills of materials, work centers, and reports**.

It looks like the workflow is designed for **ERP-style production management**, covering:

* **Stock management**
* **Bill of Materials (BOM)**
* **Work Orders**
* **Manufacturing Orders**
* **Work Centers**
* **User Reports & Analysis**

5. **Work Orders** ‚Üí Detailed execution tasks under an MO (tracks time & progress).
6. **Reports** ‚Üí Analyze efficiency and performance (expected vs actual).

---

‚úÖ **Strengths:**

* Clear ERP-style flow.
* Covers all necessary manufacturing modules.

Got it üëç ‚Äî you want the **technical step-by-step flow** for this system.
Here‚Äôs a **tech breakdown** of how the modules interact behind the scenes:

---

## üîπ Technical Steps for the Manufacturing System

### 1. **Stock Ledger (Inventory Management)**

* **Database tables**: `products`, `stock_ledger`
* **Key fields**: product\_id, unit\_cost, on\_hand, free\_to\_use, incoming, outgoing
* **Logic**:

  * `total_value = unit_cost √ó on_hand`
  * On **incoming stock** ‚Üí increment `on_hand` & `free_to_use`
  * On **outgoing stock (consumption)** ‚Üí decrement `on_hand` & `free_to_use`

---

### 2. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**

* **Database tables**: `boms`, `bom_components`
* **Key fields**: bom\_id, finished\_product\_id, quantity, reference, component\_product\_id, to\_consume\_qty
* **Logic**:

  * A BOM defines the **recipe** for a finished product.
  * When linked to a Manufacturing Order, it auto-fills components & quantities.

---

### 3. **Work Center**

* **Database tables**: `work_centers`
* **Key fields**: work\_center\_id, name, cost\_per\_hour
* **Logic**:

  * Used to calculate **operation cost** during manufacturing.
  * Links to `work_orders`.

---

### 4. **Manufacturing Order (MO)**

* **Database tables**: `manufacturing_orders`
* **Key fields**: mo\_id, finished\_product\_id, quantity, bom\_id, state, schedule\_date, assignee
* **States & Transitions**:

  * **Draft** ‚Üí Created, not confirmed
  * **Confirmed** ‚Üí Materials reserved from stock
  * **In Progress** ‚Üí Work Orders started
  * **To Close** ‚Üí All work orders finished
  * **Done** ‚Üí Final product added to stock, components consumed
  * **Cancelled** ‚Üí Locked, fields readonly
* **Logic**:

  * On confirmation ‚Üí reserve materials (`free_to_use -= required_qty`)
  * On completion ‚Üí move finished goods into stock, consume raw materials.

---

### 5. **Work Orders (WO)**

* **Database tables**: `work_orders`
* **Key fields**: wo\_id, mo\_id, operation\_name, work\_center\_id, expected\_duration, real\_duration, status
* **Logic**:

  * Derived from BOM operations (if defined).
  * Start button ‚Üí trigger timer (real\_duration tracking).
  * Stop button ‚Üí log actual time.
  * Status updates: `To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done`.

---

### 6. **Reports (Work Order Analysis)**

* **Database tables**: joins of `work_orders`, `work_centers`, `products`
* **Key fields**: operation, work\_center, product, quantity, expected\_duration, real\_duration, status
* **Logic**:

  * Compare `expected_duration` vs `real_duration`
  * Calculate efficiency % = `(expected / real) √ó 100`
  * Summarize per product, per work center, per user.

---

## üîπ Tech Stack (Suggested)

* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Django / Flask) or Node.js (Express)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (preferred for ERP), MySQL, or MongoDB (if flexible schema)
* **Frontend**: React / Angular / Vue
* **UI/UX**: TailwindCSS + wireframes ‚Üí polished UI
* **Auth**: JWT / OAuth2 for login & role management
* **Optional**:

  * Celery / Redis ‚Üí background tasks (timers, scheduling)
  * WebSockets ‚Üí real-time updates for Work Orders
  * Reporting ‚Üí Metabase / Grafana dashboards

---

‚úÖ **Flow Summary**

1. Define stock items in **Stock Ledger**.
2. Create a **Bill of Materials** for finished goods.
3. Set up **Work Centers** with cost/hour.
4. Raise a **Manufacturing Order**, link BOM & Work Orders.
5. Process **Work Orders**, track real vs expected time.
6. System updates **Stock Ledger** automatically.
7. Use **Reports** to analyze efficiency & costs.

---Great question üöÄ ‚Äì introducing **Apache Kafka** into this manufacturing ERP system adds **real-time data streaming, event-driven communication, and decoupling between services**.

Let me break it down clearly:

---

## üîπ Role of Kafka in This System

Kafka acts as the **central event bus** for all transactions in the system.
Instead of every module calling each other directly (tight coupling), they **publish events** to Kafka, and other services **consume** those events.

### ‚úÖ Benefits

* Real-time updates across modules.
* Loose coupling between Stock, Manufacturing Orders, Work Orders, Reports.
* Scalable event-driven architecture.
* Enables future integrations (IoT sensors, external ERP, analytics).

---

## üîπ Where Kafka Should Be Implemented

### 1. **Stock Ledger**

* **Producer**:

  * On stock updates (incoming, outgoing, adjustment), publish events like:

    * `stock.incoming`
    * `stock.outgoing`
    * `stock.adjustment`
* **Consumer**:

  * Manufacturing Order service listens to stock events to validate availability.
  * Reporting service consumes stock changes for dashboards.

---

### 2. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**

* Normally static (configuration), but:
* **Producer**:

  * When a BOM is created/updated ‚Üí publish `bom.updated`
* **Consumer**:

  * Manufacturing Order service listens ‚Üí auto-update default components for new MOs.

---

### 3. **Manufacturing Orders (MO)**

* **Producer**:

  * On state changes ‚Üí publish events like:

    * `mo.created`
    * `mo.confirmed`
    * `mo.in_progress`
    * `mo.completed`
    * `mo.cancelled`
* **Consumer**:

  * Stock service listens to `mo.confirmed` ‚Üí reserves stock.
  * Work Order service listens to `mo.confirmed` ‚Üí creates work orders.
  * Reporting service listens to all ‚Üí update KPIs.

---

### 4. **Work Orders (WO)**

* **Producer**:

  * On lifecycle changes ‚Üí publish:

    * `wo.created`
    * `wo.started`
    * `wo.completed`
* **Consumer**:

  * Reporting service consumes ‚Üí track real vs expected duration.
  * Manufacturing Order service consumes ‚Üí updates MO status automatically.

---

### 5. **Work Center**

* Mostly static (configuration), but:
* **Producer**:

  * If cost/hour changes ‚Üí `work_center.updated`
* **Consumer**:

  * Reporting service consumes ‚Üí recalculate costs on analysis.
  * Manufacturing Order consumes ‚Üí update operation cost estimate.

---

### 6. **Reports (Analytics / Monitoring)**

* **Consumer only**:

  * Listens to all relevant topics: stock, MO, WO, work\_center.
  * Builds **real-time dashboards** (e.g., delays, bottlenecks, efficiency).
* Could stream into **Kafka ‚Üí Sink (ElasticSearch / ClickHouse)** for fast querying.

---

## üîπ Example Kafka Topics

* `stock.events`
* `bom.events`
* `mo.events`
* `wo.events`
* `workcenter.events`
* `reporting.events`

Each can have **partitioning by entity\_id** (e.g., product\_id, mo\_id) for scalability.

---

## üîπ System Flow with Kafka Example

1. **MO Confirmed**

   * MO service publishes ‚Üí `mo.confirmed`
   * Stock service consumes ‚Üí reserves raw materials.
   * WO service consumes ‚Üí generates work orders.
   * Reporting consumes ‚Üí updates ‚ÄúConfirmed Orders‚Äù dashboard.

2. **Work Order Completed**

   * WO service publishes ‚Üí `wo.completed`
   * MO service consumes ‚Üí checks if all WOs done ‚Üí updates MO to ‚ÄúTo Close‚Äù.
   * Reporting consumes ‚Üí logs real duration.

3. **MO Done**

   * MO service publishes ‚Üí `mo.completed`
   * Stock service consumes ‚Üí moves finished product to stock, deducts consumed raw materials.
   * Reporting consumes ‚Üí updates efficiency & cost reports.

---

## üîπ Deployment Recommendation

* **Kafka Cluster**: 3 brokers minimum for HA.
* **Connectors**:

  * Kafka Connect ‚Üí push events into DB, ElasticSearch, or external systems.
* **Schema Registry** (Avro/JSON/Protobuf) ‚Üí keep event formats consistent.
* **Consumers**:

  * Stock Service
  * Manufacturing Service
  * Work Order Service
  * Reporting/Analytics Service

---

üëâ In short:
Kafka is **not storing ERP data**, but it ensures **all services remain in sync in real time**, scalable, and event-driven.

Do you want me to **sketch a system architecture diagram** (showing services + Kafka topics + DB flow), so it‚Äôs visually clear where Kafka sits?
